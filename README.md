### Women's agency and networks in Ireland (1915-1923)

The visualisations presented here were created using metadata and transcriptions from the "Letters 1916-1923" project (www.letters1916.ie).

Prof. Susan Schreibman (formerly Trinity College Dublin and NUI Maynooth, now Maastricht University) started the project in 2013.

Since then, more than 6000 letters, telegrams, postcards and notes relating to Irish history between December 1915 and the end of the Civil War in 1923 have been collected from 36 private and 29 public archives.
