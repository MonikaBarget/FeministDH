**Case Study 1: the Irish War Hospital Supply Organisation (IWHSO), 1915-1919**

The first case study relates to the *production of medical supplies for war hospitals* in the United Kingdom and abroad, carried out by female volunteers across Ireland. The collection of sphagnum moss used to make wound dressings was an especially important Irish contribution to the British war effort in the First World War.

Data from the Letters 1916-1923 collection as well as newspaper articles and government reports have been used to map the activities of women's work groups between 1915 and 1919.

The **general map** is an attempt to display as many regional depots as possible.

The [**zoomable map of female IWHSO managers in Connacht**](https://monikabarget.github.io/FeministDH/IWHSOConnacht_interactive.html) shows women's activities between 1915 and 1917. All the women mentioned here were officially part of the Galway branch although some of them came from places in neighbouring counties. One woman counted among the Galway volunteers was stationed in Malta, most likely in a British war hospital.
