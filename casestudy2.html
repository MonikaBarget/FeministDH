    <h>Case Study 2: female correspondents in the Charlie Daly collection from County Kerry, 1922-1923</h>

The second case study focusses on the Charlie Daly collection from Co. Kerry, one of Ireland's most important collections of republican correspondence relating to the Civil War (1922-1923).

Fifty percent of correspondents in this collection are female, including Charlie Daly's mother and sisters as well as neighbours and family friends.

Topic modelling and network analysis were used to understand the connections between these people and to read their letters in the overall context of social and political change in early-twentieth-century Ireland.
